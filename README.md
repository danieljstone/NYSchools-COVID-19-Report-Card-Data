# New York State Schools COVID-19 Report Card Data
As of October 8, 2020 New York State is not publishing statewide school COVID-19 data in one place.  Instead, NYS is using an online [portal](https://schoolcovidreportcard.health.ny.gov/) that only allows pulling data for individual schools.  Here, I've scraped and compiled the data from NYS for all schools that are reporting numbers to the state.  

I'm making a few inquiries to see if there are any plans for the state to just publish these data outright, but in the meantime this should suffice.
